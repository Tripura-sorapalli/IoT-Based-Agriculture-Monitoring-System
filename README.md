# IoT-Based-Agriculture-Monitoring-System
## Project Overview
This project implements a smart agriculture monitoring system using Arduino and NodeMCU (WiFi).
The system monitors:
. Soil moisture
. Temperature
. Humidity
. Sunlight intensity
The collected data is sent to an IoT cloud platform using WiFi and displayed on a dashboard. 
Automatic irrigation is triggered based on soil moisture levels.
## Objectives
Real-time environmental monitoring
 - Cloud-based data visualization
 - Smart irrigation control
 - Efficient water usage
## Technologies Used
- Arduino
- NodeMCU (ESP8266)
- DHT11 Sensor
- Soil Moisture Sensor
- LDR Sensor
- Relay Module
- IoT Cloud Platform (ThingSpeak / Adafruit IO)
