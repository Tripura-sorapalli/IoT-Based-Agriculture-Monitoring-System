# Results and Observations

## 1. Sensor Readings Observed

- Temperature range observed: 28°C – 38°C
- Humidity range observed: 45% – 75%
- Soil Moisture range observed: 20% – 65%
- Light Intensity varied based on sunlight conditions

## 2. Irrigation Performance

- When soil moisture dropped below 30%, 
  the water pump was automatically activated.

- When soil moisture increased above threshold,
  the pump was turned OFF automatically.

## 3. Cloud Monitoring

- Real-time sensor values were successfully uploaded to the IoT platform.
- Graphical visualization helped analyze environmental trends.
- Data was updated at regular intervals (15 seconds).

## 4. System Efficiency

- Reduced manual monitoring effort.
- Enabled efficient water usage.
- Improved decision-making using real-time data.

## 5. Conclusion

The IoT-based agriculture monitoring system successfully demonstrated real-time data monitoring, automatic irrigation control, and cloud-based visualization, making farming more efficient and smart.
